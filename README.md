NBehave
=======
NBehave is a framework for behaviour-driven development (BDD).

BDD is an evolution of test-driven development (TDD) and acceptance-test driven design, and it is intended to make these practices more accessible and intuitive to newcomers and experts alike.

It shifts the vocabulary from being test-based to behaviour-based and positions itself as a design philosophy.
